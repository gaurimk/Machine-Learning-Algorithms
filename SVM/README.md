Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes with the maximum margin.

üß† Objective

To classify data points into distinct categories.

To find the hyperplane that best separates classes in high-dimensional space.

To handle both linear and non-linear data using kernel functions.
‚öôÔ∏è Key Concepts

Hyperplane:

A decision boundary that separates different classes in the feature space.

In 2D, it is a line; in higher dimensions, it becomes a plane or hyperplane.

Support Vectors:

Data points closest to the hyperplane.

They determine the position and orientation of the hyperplane.

Margin:

The distance between the hyperplane and the nearest support vectors.

SVM maximizes this margin to improve generalization.

Kernels:

Transform non-linear data into higher-dimensional space for linear separation.

Common kernels include Linear, Polynomial, RBF (Gaussian), and Sigmoid.

Advantages:

Effective in high-dimensional spaces.

Works well with clear margin of separation.

Can handle non-linear relationships using kernels.

Limitations:

Computationally intensive for very large datasets.

Less effective when classes overlap heavily.

Requires careful tuning of parameters like C (regularization) and gamma (kernel coefficient).

Conclusion:

SVM is a robust and versatile algorithm for classification and regression.

It performs well in high-dimensional spaces and can model complex non-linear boundaries with kernels.

Proper parameter tuning is critical for optimal performance.
