üå≥ Decision Tree Classifier
üìò Overview

A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It splits data into branches based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure where each leaf node represents a predicted class or value.

üß† Objective

To classify data into distinct categories based on feature values.

To visually interpret how features influence predictions.

To evaluate model performance using accuracy and other metrics.

‚öôÔ∏è Steps Involved

Dataset Preparation:

Select relevant features (independent variables) and target variable (dependent).

Handle missing values and clean the dataset.

Model Training:

The Decision Tree learns decision rules by splitting features to separate classes effectively.

Each split is chosen based on a criterion like Gini impurity or Entropy.

Prediction and Evaluation:

The trained model predicts the class of new data points.

Performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization:

Trees can be visualized to show how decisions are made at each node.

Each node indicates the feature, threshold, and class distribution.

Hyperparameter Tuning:

Adjust parameters like tree depth, minimum samples per split, or the splitting criterion to improve performance and reduce overfitting.

Advantages:

Easy to understand and interpret visually.

Handles both numerical and categorical features.

Requires minimal data preprocessing.

Limitations:

Can overfit on training data if the tree is too deep.

Sensitive to small changes in data, which can lead to different trees.

May perform better in ensemble methods like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting.

Conclusion:

Decision Trees are intuitive and effective for classification tasks.

Proper tuning and pruning balance bias and variance, ensuring good generalization.

They serve as a foundation for advanced ensemble learning techniques.
