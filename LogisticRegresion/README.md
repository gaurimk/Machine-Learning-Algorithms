# 🔢 Logistic Regression

This folder contains datasets, notebooks, and resources related to the **Logistic Regression** algorithm — a widely used method for binary and multi-class classification tasks in Machine Learning.

## 🧠 Overview
**Logistic Regression** is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting categorical outcomes (e.g., 0/1, True/False).  
It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class using the **logistic (sigmoid) function**, producing outputs between 0 and 1.

## ⚙️ Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preparation** – Load and preprocess data (handle missing values, encode categories, scale features).  
2. **Model Training** – Apply Logistic Regression using `scikit-learn`.  
3. **Evaluation** – Assess performance using metrics like:
   - Accuracy  
   - Precision  
   - Recall  
   - F1-Score  
   - ROC-AUC  
4. **Visualization** – Analyze results using confusion matrix and ROC curve.
