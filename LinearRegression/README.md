# 📈 Linear Regression

This folder contains datasets, notebooks, and resources related to the **Linear Regression** algorithm — one of the most fundamental and widely used supervised learning methods in Machine Learning.

---

## 🧠 Overview
**Linear Regression** is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

The goal is to find the best-fitting straight line (`y = mx + c`) that minimizes the error between predicted and actual values.

## ⚙️ Implementation Steps
1. **Data Loading** – Import and inspect the dataset.
2. **Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, convert categorical data, and normalize features.
3. **Model Training** – Apply Linear Regression using `scikit-learn`.
4. **Evaluation** – Analyze performance using metrics like:
   - R² Score  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
5. **Visualization** – Plot actual vs. predicted values and residuals.

## 📊 Key Insights
- The Linear Regression model effectively predicts continuous numerical outcomes.
- Residual plots confirm minimal bias and good model fit.
- Evaluation metrics show the model captures most data variability.

---

## 🧰 Libraries Used
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

---

## 🔍 Future Improvements
- Implement **Ridge** and **Lasso** Regression for regularization.
- Add **Polynomial Regression** for non-linear relationships.
- Compare model performance with **Decision Tree Regression**.
