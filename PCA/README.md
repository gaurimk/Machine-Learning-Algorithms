🧠 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
📘 Overview

This project demonstrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) — a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a smaller number of uncorrelated variables called principal components.

⚙️ Steps

Loaded and standardized the dataset.

Applied PCA to reduce dimensions while retaining maximum variance.

Visualized data in 2D/3D using principal components.

Analyzed explained variance ratio to determine the importance of each component.

📊 Results

PCA effectively reduced the dataset dimensions with minimal information loss.

Visualizations showed clear separation between data classes.

Most variance retained in the first few components.

✅ Conclusion

PCA simplifies complex data, improves visualization, and enhances model performance by eliminating redundant features while preserving essential patterns.
