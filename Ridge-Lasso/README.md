Ridge and Lasso Regression are regularization techniques used to improve the performance of linear regression models by preventing overfitting. They add a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages complex models with large coefficients.

ðŸ§  Objective

To reduce overfitting in linear regression models.

To handle multicollinearity between features.

To improve model generalization on unseen data.
