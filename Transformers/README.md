Transformers — Power Transformation & ColumnTransformer are essential preprocessing tools in machine learning that help prepare data before model training. The Power Transformation technique (using methods like Yeo–Johnson or Box–Cox) is used to stabilize variance, reduce skewness, and make features more normally distributed — which is especially useful for linear models, PCA, and algorithms sensitive to non-Gaussian data. Yeo–Johnson can handle both positive and negative values, while Box–Cox works only with positive data. In Python, the PowerTransformer from Scikit-Learn automatically transforms numeric features to approximate a Gaussian distribution, improving model performance and convergence. On the other hand, the ColumnTransformer allows the application of different preprocessing steps to specific columns in a dataset — for example, imputing missing values and scaling numerical features while one-hot encoding categorical ones, all within a single object. This helps streamline preprocessing workflows, keeps transformations consistent, and integrates easily with Scikit-Learn Pipelines for model training and evaluation. Together, these transformers make the data preparation process more efficient, reproducible, and adaptable to complex datasets by combining multiple preprocessing techniques into a unified workflow.
